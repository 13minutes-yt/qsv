## [Unreleased]

## [0.113.0] - 2023-09-08 ü¶ÑüèáüèΩüé†
This is the first "[Unicorn](https://7esl.com/unicorn/)" ü¶Ñ release, adding MAJOR new features to the toolkit!

* `geocode`: adds high-speed, cache-backed, multi-threaded geocoding using a local, updateable copy of the [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) database.  This is a major improvement over the previous `geocode` subcommand in the `apply` command thanks to the wonderful [geosuggest](https://github.com/estin/geosuggest) crate.
* guaranteed non-UTF8 input detection with the `validate` and `input` commands. Quicksilver _REQUIRES_ UTF-8 input. You can now use these commands to ensure you have valid UTF-8 input before using the rest of the toolkit.
* New/expanded whirlwind tour & quick-start notebooks by @a5dur and @rzmk üé†
* Various performance improvements all-around: üèáüèΩ
  * overall increase of ~5% now that `mimalloc` - the default allocator for qsv, is built without secure mode enabled.
  * `flatten` command is now ~10% faster
  * faster regex performance thanks to various under-the-hood improvements in the [`regex`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#195-2023-09-02) crate

and last but not least - Quicksilver now has a website! - https://qsv.dathere.com/ :unicorn: :tada: :rocket:

And its not just a static site with a few links - its a full-blown web app that lets you try out qsv commands in your browser!  You can even save your commands to a gist and share them with others!

Big thanks to @rzmk for all the work on the website! And to @a5dur for all the QA work on this release!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.112.0...0.113.0

## [0.112.0] - 2023-08-15 üèáüèΩüé†
This is the second in a series of "[Giddy-up](https://7esl.com/giddy-up/)" üèáüèΩ releases, improving the performance of the following commands:

* `stats`: by refactoring the code to detect empty cells more efficiently, and by removing
unnecessary bounds checks in the main compute loop. (~10% performance improvement)
* `sample`: by refactoring the code to use an index more effectively when available - not only making it faster, but also eliminating the need to load the entire dataset into memory. Also added a `--faster` option to use a faster random number generator. (~15% performance improvement)
* `frequency`, `schema`, `search` & `validate` by amortizing/reducing allocations in hot loops
* `excel`: by refactoring the main hot loop to convert Excel cells more efficiently

The prebuilt binaries are also built with CPU optimizations enabled for x86_64 and Apple Silicon (arm64) architectures.

0.112.0 is also a "Carousel" (i.e. increased usability) üé† release featuring new Jupyter notebooks in the `contrib/notebooks` directory to help users get started with qsv.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.111.0...0.112.0

## [0.111.0] - 2023-08-07
This is the first in a series of "[Giddy-up](https://7esl.com/giddy-up/)" üèáüèΩ releases. 

As Quicksilver matures, we will continue to tweak it in our goal to be the üöÄ fastest general purpose CSV data-wrangling CLI toolkit available.

"Giddy-up" üèáüèΩ releases will do this by:
* taking advantage of new [Rust features as they become available](https://releases.rs/)
* using new libraries that are faster than the ones we currently use
* optimizing our code to take advantage of new features in the libraries we use
* using new algorithms that are faster than the ones we currently use
* taking advantage of more hardware features (SIMD, multi-core, etc.)
* adding reproducible benchmarks that are automatically updated on release to track our progress

As it is, Quicksilver has an aggressive release tempo - with more than 160 releases since its initial release in December 2020.  This was made possible by the solid foundation of Rust and the [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) project from which qsv was forked.  We will continue to build on this foundation by adding more CI tests and starting to track code coverage so we can continue to iterate aggressively with confidence.

Apart from "giddy-up" releases, Quicksilver will also have "carousel" üé† releases that will focus on making the toolkit more accessible to non-technical users.

"Carousel" üé† releases will include:
* more documentation
* more examples
* more tutorials
* more recipes in the Cookbook
* multiple GUI wrappers around the CLI
* integrations with common desktop tools like Excel, Google Sheets, Open Office, etc.

Hopefully, this will make qsv more accessible to non-technical users, and help them get more value out of their data.

Every now and then, we'll also have "Unicorn" ü¶Ñ releases that will add MAJOR new features to the toolkit (e.g. 10x type features like the integration of [Pola.rs](https://pola.rs) into qsv).

We will also add a new Technical Documentation section to the [wiki](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/wiki) to document qsv's architecture and how each command works.  The hope is doing so will [lower the barrier to contributions](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and help us grow the community of qsv contributors.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.109.0...0.110.0

## [0.109.0] - 2023-07-17
This is a monstrousüëπ release with lots of new features and improvements!

The biggest new feature is the `describegpt` command which allows you to use OpenAI's Large Language Models to generate extended metadata from a CSV. We created this command primarily for [CKAN](https://ckan.org) and [Datapusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus#datapusher) so we can infer descriptions, tags and to automatically created annotated data dictionaries using the CSV's summary statistics and frequency tables. In that way, it works even for very large CSV files without consuming too many Open AI tokens.
This is a very powerful feature and we are looking forward to seeing what people do with it. Thanks @rzmk for all the work on this!

This release also features major improvements in the `sqlp` and `joinp` commands thanks to all the new capabilities of [Polars 0.31.1](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.31.1). 

Polars SQL's capabilities have been vastly improved in 0.31.1 with numerous new SQL functions and operators, and they're all available using the `sqlp` command.

The `joinp` command has several new options for CSV parsing, for pre-join filtering (`--filter-left` and `--filter-right`), and pre-join validation with the `--validate` option. Two new asof join variants (`--left_by` and `right_by`) were also added.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.108.0...0.109.0

## [0.108.0] - 2023-06-25
Another big Quicksilver release with lots of new features and improvements!

The two [Polars](https://www.pola.rs)-powered commands - `joinp` and `sqlp` - have received significant attention. `joinp` now supports [asof joins](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/dataframe/api/polars.DataFrame.join_asof.html) and the `--try-parsedates` option. `sqlp` now has several Parquet format options, along with a `--low-memory` option.

Other new features include:

* A new `cat rowskey --group` option that [emulates csvkit's `csvstack` command](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/1053).
* SIMD-accelerated UTF-8 validation for the `input` command.
* A `--field-separator` option for the `flatten` command.
* The `sniff` command now uses the excellent [`file-format`](https://github.com/mmalecot/file-format#file-format) crate for mime-type detection on __ALL__ platforms, not just Linux, as was the case when we were using the libmagic library.

Also, QuickSilver now has optimized builds for Apple Silicon. These builds are created using native Apple Silicon self-hosted Action Runners, which means we can enable all qsv features without being constrained by cross-compilation limitations and GitHub‚Äôs Action Runner‚Äôs disk/memory constraints. Additionally, we compile Apple Silicon builds with M1/M2 chip optimizations enabled to maximize performance.

Finally, qsv startup should be noticeably faster, thanks to @vi‚Äôs [PR to avoid sysinfo::System::new_all](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1064).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.107.0...0.108.0

## [0.107.0] - 2023-06-14
We continue to improve the new [`sqlp`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/src/cmd/sqlp.rs#L2) command. It now supports scripts, Polars CSV parsing and CSV format options. We also added a new special value for the `rename` command which allows you to rename all columns in a CSV. This was done to make it easier to prepare CSVs with no headers for use with `sqlp`.

This release also features a Windows MSI installer. This is a big step forward for qsv and we hope to make it easier for Windows users to install and use qsv. Thanks @minhajuddin2510 for all the work on pulling this together!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.106.0...0.107.0

## [0.106.0] - 2023-06-07
This release features the new [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/)-powered `sqlp` command which allows you to run SQL queries against CSVs.

Initial tests show that its competitive with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and faster than [DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) on identical SQL queries, and it just runs rings around [pandasql](https://github.com/yhat/pandasql/#pandasql).

It converts Polars SQL (a subset of ANSI SQL) queries to multi-threaded LazyFrames expressions and then executes them. This is a very powerful feature and allows you to do things like joins, aggregations, group bys, etc. on larger than memory CSVs. The `sqlp` command is still experimental and we are looking for feedback on it. Please try it out and let us know what you think.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.102.0...0.102.1

## [0.102.0] - 2023-05-08
A lot of work was done on `sniff` to make it not just a CSV dialect detector, but a general purpose file type detector leveraging :magic_wand: [magic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) :sparkles: - able to detect mime types even for files on URLs.  

`sniff` can now also use the same data types as `stats` with the `--stats-types` option. This was primarily done to support metadata collection when registering CKAN resources not only during data entry, but also when checking resource links for bitrot, and when harvesting metadata from other systems, so `stats` & `sniff` can be used interchangeably based on the response time requirement and the data quality of the data source.

For example, `sniff` can be used for quickly inferring metadata by just downloading a small sample from a very large data file DURING data entry (["Resource-first upload workflow"](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus/blob/master/docs/RESOURCE_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md#Resource-first-Upload-Workflow)), with `stats` being used later on, when the data is actually being pushed to the Datastore with [Datapusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus#datapusher), when data type inferences need to be guaranteed, and the entire file will need to be scanned.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.99.1...0.101.0

## [0.99.1] - 2023-04-24
Even though this is a patch release, it actually contains a lot of new features and improvements.
This was done so that qsv version 0.99.0 and below can upgrade to this release, as the self-update logic
in older versions compared versions as strings, and not as semvers, preventing the older versions from
updating as the yanked 0.100.0 is less than anything 0.99.0 and below when compared as strings.

The changelog below is a combination of the changelog of the yanked 0.100.0 and the changes since 0.99.0.

### Fixed
* `excel`: Float serialization correctness by @bluepython508 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/933
* `luau`: only create qsv_cache directory when needed https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/930
* `luau`: make `qsv_shellcmd()` helper function work with Windows https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f867158c4c7eaf10c18092b2a4c88ff67cc3a487 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/cc24acba3c916184059e7e9d776dce9e35294d44
* Self update semver parsing fixed so versions are compared as semvers, not as strings. This prevented self-update from updating from 0.99.0 to 0.100.0 as 0.99.0 > 0.100.0 when compared as string. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/940
* fixed werr macro to also format! messages https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c3ceaf713683ddb70e40a293f494f15144cc78fb

## New Contributors
* @bluepython508 made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/933

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.99.0...0.99.1

## [0.100.0] - 2023-04-18 (YANKED)
0.100.0 was yanked as it was comparing versions as strings instead of semver.
So "0.100.0" is less than "0.99.0", and self-update won't work.

## [0.99.0] - 2023-04-10
### Added
* added [Snappy](https://google.github.io/snappy/) auto-compression/decompression support. The Snappy format was chosen primarily
because it supported streaming compression/decompression and is designed for performance. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/911
* added `snappy` command. Although files ending with the ".sz" extension are automatically compressed/decompressed, the `snappy` command offers 4-5x faster multi-threaded compression. It can also be used to check if a file is Snappy-compressed or not, and can be used to compress/decompress any file. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/911 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/916

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.89.0...0.90.0

## [0.89.0] - 2023-02-20

### Added
* `cat`: added new `rowskey` subcommand. Unlike the existing `rows` subcommand, it allows far more flexible concatenation of CSV files by row, even if the files have different number of columns and column order. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/795
* added jemalloc support. As the current default mimalloc allocator is not supported in some platforms. Also, for certain workloads, jemalloc may be faster. See [Memory Allocator](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/docs/PERFORMANCE.md#memory-allocator) for more info https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/796
* added `--no-memcheck` and related `QSV_NO_MEMORY_CHECK` env var. This relaxes the conservative Out-of-Memory prevention heuristic of qsv. See [Memory Management](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv#memory-management) for more info https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/792

### Changed
* `--version` now returns max input file size when running in "non-streaming" mode, and detailed memory info. See [Version details](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/docs/PERFORMANCE.md#version-details) for more info https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/780
* `exclude`: expanded usage text and added 'input parameters' help by @tmtmtmtm in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/783

* removed utf8 first 8k screening. It was increasing code complexity and not very reliable. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/782

### Fixed
* `dedup`: refactored to use iterators to avoid out of bounds errors. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f5e547b68410407851f217c706ad303bdbc5a583
* `exclude`: don't screen for utf8. This bugfix spurred the utf8 validation revamp, where I realized, I just needed to pull out utf8 screening https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/781
* `py`:  `col`, not `row` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/793

## New Contributors
* @tmtmtmtm made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/783

### Changed
* also show `--update` and `--updatenow` errors on stderr https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/770

Better error messages; clamp free memory headroom percentage between 10 and 90 percent https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/6701ebfae58e942117378996ec6679544f620cbf and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/5cd8a95e7b36819f75f0d3bb8172dcff601b649b
* improved utf8 check error messages to give more detail, and not just say there is an encoding error https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c9b5b075d31b9639958193db919683475c3e3ba5

* removed mispublished 0.88.1 release

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.88.0...088.2

## [0.88.0] - 2023-02-13

### Added
* `extdedup`: new command to deduplicate arbitrarily large CSV/text files using a memory-buffered, on-disk hash table. Not only does it dedup very large files using constant memory, it does so while retaining the file's original sort order, unlike `dedup` which loads the entire file into memory to sort it first before deduping by comparing neighboring rows https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/762
* Added Out-of-Memory (OOM) handling for "non-streaming" commands (i.e. commands that load the entire file into memory) using a heuristic that if an input file's size is lower than the free memory available minus a default headroom of 20 percent, qsv processing stops gracefully with a detailed message about the potential OOM condition. This headroom can be adjusted using the `QSV_FREEMEMORY_HEADROOM_PCT` environment variable, which has a minimum value of 10 percent https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/767
* add `-Q, --quiet` option to all commands that return counts to stderr (`dedup`, `extdedup`, `search`, `searchset` and `replace`) in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/768

### Changed
* `sort` & `sortcheck`: separate test suites and link from usage text https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/756
* `frequency`: amortize allocations, preallocate with_capacity. Informal benchmarking shows an improvement of ~30%! :rocket: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/761
* `extsort`: refactor. Aligned options with `extdedup`; now also support stdin/stdout; added `--memory-limit` option  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/763
* `safenames`: minor optimization https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a7df378e0a755300e541dec0fef0b12d39b215f2
* `excel`: minor optimization https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/75eac7875e276b45e668cbe91271ad86cec8db49
* `stats`: add date inferencing false positive warning, with a recommendation how to prevent false positives https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a84a4e614b5c14dd2e0d523bec4c6d9dbeb7c3ba
* `sortcheck`: added note to usage text that dupe_count is only valid if file is sorted https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/ab69f144fa2ac375255bf9fbd6dd08bf538c1dfa
* reorganized Installation section to differentiate different options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/9ef8bfc0b90574b41629c7c7bd463289dc1dcb62
* bump MSRV to 1.67.1

### Fixed
* `sortcheck`: correct wrong progress message showing invalid dupe_count (as dupe count is only valid if the file is sorted) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/8eaa8240249c5c7eb1ece068764a8caa7e804414
* `py` & `luau`: correct usage text about stderr https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/1b56e72988e2dee1502517f8e2dbf036416efb8d


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.87.1...0.88.0

## [0.87.1] - 2023-02-02

### Changed
* `safenames`: refactor in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/754
   - better handling of headers that start with a digit, instead of replacing the digit with a _, prepend the unsafe prefix
   - quoted identifiers are also considered unsafe, unless conditional mode is used
   - verbose modes now also return a list of duplicate header names
* update MSRV to 1.67.0
* cargo update bump depedencies
* disable optimization on test profile for faster CI compilation, which was taking much longer than test run time
* optimize prebuilt nightlies to compile with target-cpu=native
* pin Rust nightly to 2023-02-01

### Fixed
^ `safenames`: fixed mode behavior inconsistencies https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/754
all modes now use the same safenames algorithm. Before, the verbose modes used a simpler one leading to inconsistencies between modes (resolves safenames handling inconsistent between modes #753)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.87.0...0.88.0

## [0.87.0] - 2023-01-29

### Added
* `apply`: add decimal separator --replacement option to thousands operation. This fully rounds out `thousands` formatting, as it will allow formatting numbers to support "euro-style" formats (e.g. 1.234.567,89 instead of 1,234,567.89) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/749
* `apply`: add round operation; also refactored thousands operation to use more appropriate `--formatstr` option instead of `--comparand` option to specify "format" of thousands separator policy https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/751
* `applydp`: add round operation  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/752

### Changed
* changed MSRV policy to track latest Rust version in Homebrew, instead of latest Rust stable
* removed excess trailing whitespace in `apply` & `applydp` usage text
* moved `round_num` function from `stats.rs` to `util.rs` so it can be used in round operation in `apply` and `applydp`
* cargo update bump dependencies, notably tokio from 1.24.2 to 1.25.0
* pin Rust nightly to 2023-01-28

### Fixed
* `apply`: corrected thousands operation usage text - `hexfour` not `hex_four` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/6545aa2b3ce470b5f6c039c998e9f6fc21a6ad84


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.86.0...0.87.0


## [0.86.0] - 2023-01-29

### Added
* `apply`: added `thousands` operation which adds thousands separators to numeric values.
Specify the separator policy with --comparand (default: comma). The valid policies are:
comma, dot, space, underscore, hexfour (place a space every four hex digits) and
indiancomma (place a comma every two digits, except the last three digits). https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/748
* `searchset`: added `--unmatched-output` option. This was done to allow Datapusher+ to screen for PIIs more efficiently. Writing PII candidate records in one CSV file, and the "clean" records in another CSV in just one pass.  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/742


### Changed
* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: expanded usage text info on HTTP2 Adaptive Flow Control support
* `fetchpost`: added more detail about `--compress` option
* `stats`: added more tests

### Fixed
* `stats`: fixed antimodes null display. Use the literal `NULL` instead of just "" when listing NULL as an antimode. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/745
* `tojsonl`: fixed invalid escaping of JSON values https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/746

### Added
* `stats`: add sparsity to "streaming" statistics https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/719
* `schema`: also infer enum constraints for integer fields. Not only good for validation, this is also required by `tojsonl` for smarter boolean inferencing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/721

### Changed
* `stats`: change `--typesonly` so it will not automatically `--infer-dates`. Let the user decide. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/718
* `stats`: if median is already known, use it to calculate Median Absolute Deviation https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/08ed08da4651a96bf05372b34b670063fbcec14f
* `tojsonl`: smarter boolean inferencing. It will infer a column as boolean if it only has a domain of two values,
and the first character of the values are one of the following case-insensitive "truthy/falsy"
combinations: t/f; t/null; 1/0; 1/null; y/n & y/null are treated as true/false. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/722 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/723

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.81.0...0.82.0

## [0.81.0] - 2023-01-02

### Added
* `stats`: added range statistic https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/691
* `stats`: added additional mode stats. For mode, added mode_count and mode_occurrences. Added "antimode" (opposite of mode - least frequently occurring non-zero value), antimode_count and antimode_occurrences. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/694
* qsv-dateparser now recognizes unix timestamp values with fractional seconds to nanosecond precision as dates. `stats`, `sniff`, `apply datefmt` and `schema`, which all use qsv-dateparser, now infer unix timestamps as dates - https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a29ff8ea255d5aed9992556a0a23ab76117c8340 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/702
> USAGE NOTE: As timestamps can be float or integer, and data type inferencing will guess dates last, preprocess timestamp columns with apply datefmt first to more date-like, non-timestamp formats, so they are recognized as dates by other qsv commands.

### Changed

The user will need to invoke the `--update` option explicitly. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/622

### Changed:
* `stats`: Speedup type checking by @kindly in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/625

## New Contributors
* @minhajuddin2510 made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/542

## [0.69.0] - 2022-09-28

### Added
* `luajit`: new command using LuaJIT, which is much faster than Lua https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/500

### Changed
* `python`: tweaks. Expanded usage text. Only show python version when logging is on.  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/507
* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: apply clippy recommendation https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/dd7220bce2811d9e8248c379af5d5c38da3b02d5

* `extsort`: fixed --help bug (https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/506)

## [0.68.0] - 2022-09-16
### Changed
* Simplify python support. For prebuilt binaries, Python 3.10 is now required and the python 3.10 shared libraries are bundled for select platforms.
If you require an earlier version of Python (3.6 and up), you'll have to install/compile from source. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/492
* Smarter self update. --update can still be explicitly invoked even when self-update feature has been disabled. Further, if you compiled qsv from source,
self-update will only notify you of new releases, instead of proceeding with self-update. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/490 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/493
* `lua`: switch from Lua 5.4 to LuaJIT 2.1, primarily for performance https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/495

* cargo update bumped several dependencies
* pin Rust nightly to 2022-09-14

### Fixed
* fix typos by @kianmeng in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/491
* `python`: better error handling. When mapping/filtering, python expression errors no longer cause a panic, but instead fail to map/filter as expected (when mapping, "\<ERROR\>" is returned, when filtering, the filter is not applied), and continue processing. Also, other errors are properly propagated instead of panicking. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/496
* `lua`: better error handling. When mapping/filtering, Lua errors no longer cause a panic, but instead fail to map/filter as expected (when mapping, "\<ERROR\>" is returned, when filtering, the filter is not applied), and continue processing. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/497

## [0.67.0] - 2022-09-09
### Added
* added `self_update` feature, so users can build qsv without self-update engine https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/483 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/484

* set RUSTFLAGS to emit=asm when compiling pre-built binaries for performance
  see http://likebike.com/posts/How_To_Write_Fast_Rust_Code.html#emit-asm

### Fixed
* `extsort` code was being compiled for qsvdp even if it was not enabled
* bump sysinfo from 0.25.2 to 0.26.0, fixing segfault on Apple Silicon
* fixed qsvnp on Windows so it doesn't look for python shared libraries even if python is not enabled
* fixed CliError::Other so it returns bad exitcode (exitcode 1) instead of incorrect_usage (exit code 2)

## New Contributors
* @udsamani made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/462

## [0.65.0] - 2022-08-28

### Added
* Major refactoring of main variants - removing redundant code and moving them to a new module - clitypes.rs. Added custom exit codes. 
  Removed need to have --exitcode option in several commands as qsv now returns exit codes for ALL commands in a standard way. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/460
* Major refactoring of CI test helpers in workdir.rs

### Changed
* `py`: use python interning to amortize allocs https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/457
* `search` & `searchset`: return num of matches to stderr; add --quick option; remove --exitcode option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/458
* `extsort`: improved error handling
* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: better --report option handling https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/451
* `lua`: faster number to string conversion using itoa and ryu
* `replace`: removed --exitcode option
* `sortcheck`: --json options now always cause full scan of CSV
* `stats`: expanded usage text, explicitly listing stats that require loading the entire CSV into memory. Mentioned data type inferences are guaranteed.
* cargo update bumped several dependencies
* pin Rust nightly to 2022-08-27

### Fixed
* `py`: batched python processing refactor. Instead of using one GILpool for one session, `py` now processes in batches of 30,000 rows, releasing memory after each batch.  This resulted in memory consumption levelling out, instead of increasing to gigabytes of memory with very large files. As an added bonus, this made the `py` command ~30% faster in testing. :smile:  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/456

## [0.64.0] - 2022-08-23

## [0.58.2] - 2022-07-02
### Changed
* Pin Rust nightly to 2022-07-02

### Fixed
* fixed redis dev-dependency which mistakenly added a non-existent ahash feature. This prevented publishing of qsv 0.58.1 to crates.io.

## [0.58.1] - 2022-07-02
### Changed
* Universal clippy handling. Added allow clippy hint section in main for clippy lints we allow/ignore, and added exceptions as needed throughout the codebase.
This means clippy, even in pedantic/nursery/perf mode will have no warnings. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/365

### Fixed
* `excel`: fixed docopt usage text which prevents --help from working
* `extsort`: better parsing/error-handling, instead of generic panic when no input/output is specified. This also allows --help to be displayed.

## [0.58.0] - 2022-07-02
### Added
* `excel`: add --list-sheets option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/364
* `fetch`: added 0 option to --rate-limit to go as fast as possible.  
**CAUTION:** Only use this with APIs that have [RateLimit](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html) headers so qsv can automatically down-throttle as required. Otherwise, the fetch job will look like a Denial-of-Service attack. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e4ece60aea3720b872119ca7a8ad3666dad033e7
* `fetch`: added --max-errors option. Maximum number of errors before aborting

### Changed

* `fetch`: added additional verbiage to usage text on how to pass multiple key-value pairs to the HTTP header
* `fetch`: made RateLimit jitters (required to avoid [thundering herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) issues as per the [RateLimit spec](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html#resource-exhaustion-and-clock-skew)) shorter, as they were too long.

### Changed
* Switch to qsv_sniffer fork of csv_sniffer. [qsv_sniffer](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv-sniffer) has several optimizations (field name sniffing, utf-8 encoding detection, 
SIMD speedups, [etc.](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv-sniffer/releases/tag/0.4.0)) that enabled the added `sniff` features above. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/320

* `schema`: Fix bug with enum by @mhuang74 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/163

## [0.32.0] - 2022-02-06
### Added
* `schema` POC by @mhuang74 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/155
* `schema`: add value constraints via stats  by @mhuang74 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/158

### Changed
* `stats` data type inference changed to more straightforward "String" from "Unicode"
* changed CI/CD to use rust-cache GitHub Actions making it ~3x faster.
* always build and test with `--locked` flag. This allows us to use rust-cache and guarantee that
  builds are using the exact dependency versions qsv requires.

* bumped jsonschema dependency to to 0.15.
* always build/publish with `--locked` flag in CI/CD.
* enclose environment variable values with double quotes when using `--envlist` option
* use more captured identifiers in format strings.

### Added
* added `--helper` option to `py` command. This allows users to load a python user helper script as a module named `qsv_uh`. [Example](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/78046d922e9a530c0887f18065fc325049b58687/tests/test_py.rs#L93)

## [0.26.1] - 2021-12-21
### Fixed
* explicitly include `deflate` compression method for self_update. Otherwise, `--update` unzipping doesn't work.
## [0.26.0] - 2021-12-21
### Changed
* `fetch` refinements. Still WIP, but usable (See [#77](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/77))
  - add default user agent
  - `fetch` progress bar
  - `--jobs`, `--throttle`, `--header`, `--store-error` and `cookies` options still not functional.

`self_update` and `jql` where we worked with the crate maintainers directly with the update.

### Fixed
* `--update` bug fixed. It was not finding the binary to self update properly.


## [0.25.2-beta] - 2021-12-13
## Added
* `fetch` command by [@mhuang74](https://github.com/mhuang74). Note that the command is functional but still WIP, that's why this is a beta release.

## New Contributors
* @mhuang74 made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/116
## [0.23.0] - 2021-11-29
### Added
- added `--update` option. This allows qsv to check and update itself if there are new release binaries published on GitHub.
- added `--envlist` option to show all environment variables with the `QSV_` prefix.
- `apply`, `generate`, `lua`, `foreach` and `selfupdate` are now optional features. `apply` and `generate` are marked optional since they have
large dependency trees; `lua` and `foreach` are very powerful commands that can be abused to issue system commands. Users now have the option exclude these features from their local builds.  Published binaries on GitHub still have `-all-features` enabled.
- added `QSV_COMMENTS` environment variable (contributed by [@jbertovic](https://github.com/jbertovic)). This allows qsv to ignore lines in the CSV (including headers) that start with the set character. [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/feae8cf5750530318b83c4b3c7bf0f72d2332079/tests/test_comments.rs#L3)
- catch input empty condition when qsv's input is empty when using `select`.   
(e.g. `cat /dev/null | qsv select 1` will now show the error "Input is empty." instead of "Selector index 1 is out of bounds. Index must be >= 1 and <= 0.")
- added `--pad <arg>` option to `split` command to zero-pad the generated filename by the number of `<arg>` places. [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/feae8cf5750530318b83c4b3c7bf0f72d2332079/tests/test_split.rs#L81)
- tests for `QSV_COMMENTS`, `split --pad`, `select` input empty condition, 
### Changed
- set Cargo.toml to Rust 2021 edition
- added "command-line-utilities" category to crates.io metadata
- cargo update bumped `mimalloc`, `serde_json`, `syn`, `anyhow` and `ryu`.
- GitHub Actions CI tests runs with `--all-features` enabled.
- published binaries on GitHub have `--all-features` enabled by default.
- made geocode caching a tad faster by making the transitional cache unbounded, and simplifying the key.
- `--version` now also shows the number of logical CPUs detected.
- project-wide rustfmt
- documentation for features, `QSV_COMMENTS` and `apply`
### Removed
- removed greetings.yml workflow from GitHub Actions.

## [0.22.1] - 2021-11-22
### Added
- added `lua` and `foreach` feature flags. These commands are very powerful and can be easily abused or get into "foot-shooting" scenarios.
They are now only enabled when these features are enabled during install/build.
- `censor` and `censor_check` now support the addition of custom profanities to screen for with the --comparand option.
### Changed
- removed `lazy_static` and used `once_cell` instead
- smaller stripped binaries for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin` targets
- expanded `apply` help text
- added more tests (currencytonum, censor, censor_check)

## [0.22.0] - 2021-11-15
### Added
- `generate` command. Generate test data by profiling a CSV using a [Markov decision process](https://docs.rs/test-data-generation).
- add `--no-headers` option to `rename` command (see [discussion #81](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/81#discussioncomment-1599027))
- Auto-publish binaries for more platforms on release
- added combo-test for sort-dedup-sort (see [discussion #80](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/80#discussioncomment-1610190))
- New environment variables galore
  - `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` - single ascii character to use as delimiter.  Overrides `--delimeter` option. Defaults to "," (comma) for CSV files and "\t" (tab) for TSV files, when not set. Note that this will also set the delimiter for qsv's output. Adapted from [xsv PR](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/pull/94) by [@camerondavison](https://github.com/camerondavison).
  - `QSV_NO_HEADERS` - when set, the first row will **NOT** be interpreted as headers. Supersedes `QSV_TOGGLE_HEADERS`.
  - `QSV_MAX_JOBS` - number of jobs to use for parallelized commands (currently `frequency`, `split` and `stats`). If not set, max_jobs is set
to number of logical processors divided by four.  See [Parallelization](#parallelization) for more info.
  - `QSV_REGEX_UNICODE` - if set, makes `search`, `searchset` and `replace` commands unicode-aware. For increased performance, these
commands are not unicode-aware and will ignore unicode values when matching and will panic when unicode characters are used in the regex.
- Added parallelization heuristic (num_cpus/4), in connection with `QSV_MAX_JOBS`.
- Added more tests
  - `apply` (test for regex_replace, eudex, and lat/long parsing)
  - combo-test (see above) - for testing qsv command combinations
  - tests for `QSV_NO_HEADERS` environment variable
  - tests for `QSV_REGEX_UNICODE` environment variable in `search`, `searchset` and `replace` commands
  - tests for `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` environment variable
### Changed
- MSRV of Rust 1.56
- expanded `apply` help-text examples
- progress bar now only updates every 1% progress by default
- replaced English-specific soundex with multi-lingual eudex algorithm (see https://docs.rs/crate/eudex/0.1.1)
- refactored `apply geocode` subcommand to improve cache performance
- improved lat/long parsing - can now recognize embedded coordinates in text
- changed `apply operations regex_replace` behavior to do all matches in a field, instead of just the left-most one, to be consistent with the behavior of `apply operations replace`

## [0.21.0] - 2021-11-07
### Added
- added `apply geocode` caching, more than doubling performance in the geocode benchmark.
- added `--random` and `--seed` options to `sort` command from [@pjsier](https://github.com/pjsier).
- added qsv tab completion section to README.
- additional `apply operations` subcommands:
  * Match Trim operations - enables trimming of more than just whitespace, but also of multiple trim characters in one pass ([Example](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/9569dd7c2a897e0a47b97e1abfd1c3efab920990/tests/test_apply.rs#L214)):
    * mtrim: Trims `--comparand` matches left & right of the string ([trim_matches](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.trim_matches) wrapper)
    * mltrim: Left trim `--comparand` matches ([trim_start_matches](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.trim_start_matches) wrapper)
    * mrtrim: Right trim `--comparand` matches ([trim_end_matches](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.trim_end_matches) wrapper)
  * replace: Replace all matches of a pattern (using `--comparand`)
      with a string (using `--replacement`) (Std::String [replace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.replace) wrapper).
  * regex_replace: Replace the leftmost-first regex match with `--replacement` (regex [replace](https://docs.rs/regex/1.1.0/regex/struct.Regex.html#method.replace) wrapper).
  * titlecase - capitalizes English text using Daring Fireball titlecase style
      https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case
  * censor_check: check if profanity is detected (boolean) [Examples](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/9569dd7c2a897e0a47b97e1abfd1c3efab920990/tests/test_apply.rs#L66)
  * censor: profanity filter
- added parameter validation to `apply operations` subcommands
- added more robust parameter validation to `apply` command by leveraging docopt
- added more tests
- added `rust-version` in Cargo.toml to specify MSRV of rust 1.56

### Changed
- revamped benchmark script:
  * allow binary to be changed, so users can benchmark xsv and other xsv forks by simply replacing the $bin shell variable
  * now uses a much larger data file - a 1M row, 512 mb, 41 column sampling of NYC's 311 data
  * simplified and cleaned-up script now that it's just using 1 data file
- Upgrade rand and quickcheck crates to latest releases (0.8.4 and 1.0.3 respectively), and modified code accordingly.
- `cargo update` bumped addr2line (0.16.0->0.17.0), backtrace (0.3.62->0.3.63), gimli (0.25.0->0.26.1) and anyhow (1.0.44->1.0.45)

### Removed
- removed `scramble` command as its function is now subsumed by the `sort` command with the `--random` and `--seed` options
- removed `num-format` crate which has a large dependency tree with several old crates; replaced with much smaller `thousands` crate.
- removed 1M row, 48mb, 7 column world_cities_pop_mil.csv as its no longer used by the revamped benchmark script.
- removed `build.rs` build dependency that was checking for MSRV of Rust >= "1.50". Instead, took advantage of new [`rust-version`](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0.html#cargo-rust-version) Cargo.toml option
introduced in Rust 1.56.

## [0.20.0] - 2021-10-31
### Added
- added string similarity operations to `apply` command:
  * simdl: Damerau-Levenshtein similarity
  * simdln: Normalized Damerau-Levenshtein similarity (between 0.0 & 1.0)
  * simjw: Jaro-Winkler similarity (between 0.0 & 1.0)
  * simsd: S√∏rensen-Dice similarity (between 0.0 & 1.0)
  * simhm: Hamming distance. Number of positions where characters differ.
  * simod: OSA Distance.
  * soundex: sounds like (boolean)
- added progress bars to commands that may spawn long-running jobs - for this release,
`apply`, `foreach`, and `lua`. Progress bars can be suppressed with `--quiet` option.
- added progress bar helper functions to utils.rs.
- added `apply` to benchmarks.
- added sample NYC 311 data to benchmarks.
- added records per second (RECS_PER_SEC) to benchmarks

### Changed
- major refactoring of `apply` command:
  - to take advantage of docopt parsing/validation.
  - instead of one big command, broke down apply to several subcommands:
    - operations
    - emptyreplace
    - datefmt
    - geocode
- simplified lat/long regex validator to no longer validate range, as the underlying 
geocoder function validates it already - 18% geocode speedup.
- bumped docopt back up to 1.1.1.
- improved error message when specifying an invalid apply operation.

## [0.19.0] - 2021-10-24
### Added
- new `scramble` command. Randomly scrambles a CSV's records.
- read/write buffer capacity can now be set using environment variables
`QSV_RDR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` and `QSV_WTR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` (in bytes).
- added additional test for `apply datefmt`.

### Changed
- default read buffer doubled from 8k to 16k.
- default write buffer doubled from 32k to 64k.
- benchmark script revamped. Now produces aligned output onscreen,
while also creating a benchmark TSV file; downloads the sample file from GitHub;
benchmark more commands.
- version info now also returns memory allocator being used, and number of cpus detected.
- minor refactor of `enumerate`, `explode`, `fill` and `foreach` commands.

### Removed
- removed benchmark data from repository. Moved to GitHub wiki instead.

## [0.18.2] - 2021-10-21
## Changed
- use docopt v1.1.0 instead of docopt v.1.1.1 for docopt to support all regex features

## [0.18.1] - 2021-10-20
### Added
- added `mimalloc` feature flag. [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) is Microsoft's performance-oriented memory allocator.
Earlier versions of qsv used mimalloc by default. Now it is only used when the feature is set.
- README: Added Performance section.
- README: Document how to enable `mimalloc` feature.

### Changed
- README: Explicitly show how to set environment variables on different platforms.
## [0.18.0] - 2021-10-18
### Added
- `stats` `mode` is now also multi-modal -i.e. returns multiples modes when detected. 
e.g. mode[1,1,2,2,3,4,6,6] will return [1,2,6].
It will continue to return one mode if there is only one detected.
- `stats` `quartile` now also computes IQR, lower/upper fences and skew ([using Pearson's median skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#Pearson's_second_skewness_coefficient_(median_skewness))). For code simplicity, calculated skew with quartile.
- `join` now also support `left-semi` and `left-anti` joins, the same way [Spark does](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-join.html#semi-join).
- `search` `--flag` option now returns row number, not just '1'.
- `searchset` `--flag` option now returns row number, followed by a semi-colon, and a list of matching regexes.
- README: Added badges for Security Audit, Discussion & Docs
- README: Added FAQ link in fork note.

### Changed
- point to https://docs.rs/crate/qsv for documentation.
- README: `stats` and `join` section updated with new features.
- README: wordsmithing - replaced "CSV data" and "CSV file/s" with just "CSV".
- in `stats` changed `q2` column name to `q2_median`.
- removed debug symbols in release build for smaller binaries.
- minor refactoring of `search`, `searchset` & `stats`.

### Fixed
- README: fixed `flatten` example.

### Removed
- removed Rust badge.

## [0.17.3] - 2021-10-12
### Added
- added [sample regexset file](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/d209436b588b88b0f92cc133ebcada726f72a2bd) for PII-screening.

### Changed
- `apply geocode --formatstr` now accepts less US-centric format selectors.
- `searchset --flag` now shows which regexes match as a list (e.g. "[1, 3, 5]"), not just "1" or "0".
### Fixed
- `foreach` command now returns error message on Windows. `foreach` still doesn't work on 
Windows (yet), but at least it returns "foreach command does not work on Windows.".
- `apply geocode` was not accepting valid lat/longs below the equator. Fixed regex validator.
- more robust `searchset` error handling when attempting to load regexset files.
- `apply` link on README was off by one. 
## [0.17.2] - 2021-10-10

### Changed
- bumped `dateparser` to 0.1.6. This now allows `apply datefmt` to properly reformat
dates without a time component. Before, when reformatting a date like "July 4, 2020", 
qsv returns "2020-07-04T00:00:00+00:00". It now returns "2020-07-04".
- minor clippy refactoring
### Removed
- removed rust-stats submodule introduced in 0.17.1. It turns out
crates.io does not allow publishing of crates with local dependencies on submodules. 
Published the modified rust-stats fork as qsv-stats instead. This allows us to publish
qsv on crates.io
- removed unused `textwrap` dependency
## [0.17.1] - 2021-10-10
### Fixed
- explicitly specified embedded modified rust-stats version in Cargo.toml. 
## [0.17.0] - 2021-10-10
### Added
- added `searchset` command. Run **multiple regexes** over CSV data in a **single pass**.
- added `--unicode` flag to `search`, `searchset` and `replace` commands.
Previously, regex unicode support was on by default, which comes at the cost of performance.
And since `qsv` optimizes for performance ("q is for quick"), it is now off by default.
- added quartiles calculation to `stats`. Pulled in upstream
[pending](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-stats/pull/15) [PRs](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/pull/273) 
from [@m15a](https://github.com/m15a) to implement.

### Changed
- changed variance algorithm. For some reason, the previous variance algorithm was causing
intermittent test failures on macOS. Pulled in [pending upstream PR](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-stats/pull/11)
from [@ruppertmillard](https://github.com/ruppertmillard).
- embedded [rust-stats fork](https://github.com/jqnatividad/rust-stats) submodule which implements 
quartile and new variance algorithm.
- changed GitHub Actions to pull in submodules.

### Fixed
- the project was not following semver properly, as several new features were released 
in the 0.16.x series that should have been MINOR version bumps, not PATCH bumps.

## [0.16.4] - 2021-10-08
### Added
- added `geocode` operation to `apply` command. It geocodes to the closest city given a column   
with coordinates in Location format ('latitude, longitude') using a static geonames lookup file.

## [0.16.0] - 2021-09-28
### Added
- Added a CHANGELOG.
- Added additional commands/options from [@Yomguithereal](https://github.com/Yomguithereal) 
[xsv fork](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/xsv).
  * `apply` - Apply series of string transformations to a CSV column.
  * `behead` - Drop headers from CSV file.
  * `enum` - Add a new column enumerating rows by adding a column of incremental or 
  uuid identifiers. Can also be used to copy a column or fill a new column with a constant value.
  * `explode` - Explode rows into multiple ones by splitting a column value based on the given separator.
  * `foreach` - Loop over a CSV file to execute bash commands.
  * `jsonl` - Convert newline-delimited JSON to CSV.
  * `lua` - Execute a Lua script over CSV lines to transform, aggregate or filter them.
  * `pseudo` -  Pseudonymise the value of the given column by replacing them by an incremental identifier.
  * `py` - Evaluate a Python expression over CSV lines to transform, aggregate or filter them.
  * `replace` - Replace CSV data using a regex.
  * `sort` --uniq option - When set, identical consecutive lines will be dropped to keep only one line 
  per sorted value.
  * `search` --flag `column` option -  If given, the command will not filter rows but will instead flag 
  the found rows in a new column named `column`.

- Added conditional compilation logic for `foreach` command to only 
compile on `target_family=unix` as it has a dependency on 
`std::os::unix::ffi::OsStrExt` which only works in unix-like OSes.
- Added `empty0` and `emptyNA` operations to `apply` command with 
corresponding test cases.
- Added GitHub Actions to check builds on `ubuntu-latest`, 
`windows-latest` and `macos-latest`.
