xcsv is a command line program for slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining 
CSV files. There are two primary goals: performance and simplicity. To be more 
concrete:

1. xcsv should never be the bottleneck when parsing CSV data. (Performance.)
2. With xcsv, it should be easy to perform simple tasks.

As the project evolves, the importance of the following will become clearer:

1. The flexibility of reading malformed CSV data.
2. The number of features supported by xcsv.


**WORK IN PROGRESS**.
