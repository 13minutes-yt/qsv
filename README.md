xsv is a command line program for slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining
CSV files. There are two primary goals: performance and compositionality. To be
more concrete:

1. With xsv, it should be easy to perform simple tasks.
2. Behavior that affects performance should be made explicit (and documented)
   in the command line interface.
3. xsv commands should be easily composable.

This README contains information on how to install `xsv` and a full set of
examples that demonstrate much of its functionality.
