xsv is a command line program for slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining 
CSV files. There are two primary goals: performance and simplicity. To be more 
concrete:

1. With xsv, it should be easy to perform simple tasks.
2. Behavior that affects performance should be made explicit (and documented)
   in the command line interface.

As the project evolves, the importance of the following will become clearer:

1. The flexibility of reading malformed CSV data.
2. The number of features supported by xsv.
