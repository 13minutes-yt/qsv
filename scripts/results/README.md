These benchmarks results are compiled on my main development machine -
an Apple Mac Mini 2023 model with an M2 Pro chip with 12 CPU cores and 32GB of RAM;
a 1TB SSD primary drive and a 1TB Samsung SSD 970 Evo plus external drive
running MacOS Sonoma Public Beta.

It uses the prebuilt, CPU optimized qsv binary variant in aarch64-apple-darwin.zip
