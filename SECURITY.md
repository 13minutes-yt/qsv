# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

qsv has a very rapid release tempo, with at least one release/week.
It has a built-in self-update engine that makes it very convenient to 
upgrade to the latest version.
As such, only the latest release will have security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability, pleases [create an issue](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/new/choose) in GitHub.

However, if a vulnerability is severe and could lead to zero-day
exploits, please send an email to mailto:qsv-severe@datHere.com instead.

The vulnerability report will be addressed within one business day. A 
mitigation/workaround, if available, will be included in the next release and mentioned
in the changelog, with zero-day mitigations only being mentioned only when it's
been fully fixed.
